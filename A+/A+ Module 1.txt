Skills and Abilities 1.1.2
- problem Solving 
	- step-by-step process 
	- sometimes look out side the boxes might work more effectively for you and the organization 

-Communication and Organization
	- sometimes a quickly phone call 
	- sometimes a written communication 
	- require good oral and written communication 
	- accurate documentation and records 

-Technical Knowledge
	- Lifelong learner 


-------------------------------------------------
The troubleshooting Methodology 1.2
- learning outcomes 
	- What is the troubleshooting methodology?
	- Why would a technician want to utilize a process to troubleshoot?

-----------------------------------------------
Best Practice Methodology 1.2.1
- causes, symptoms, and consequences
	- A computer system has a fault in the hard disk drive (cause).
	- Because the disk drive is faulty, the operating system is displaying a "blue screen" (symptom).
	- Because of the fault, the user cannot do any work (consequence).

	1- Identify the problem:
		- Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before making changes.
			- Begin documentation of the problem. Update as necessary throughout the full process.
		- Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes.
	2- Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious):
		- If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms.
	3- Test the theory to determine the cause:
		- Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem.
		- If the theory is not confirmed, reestablish a new theory or escalate.
	4- Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution:
		- Refer to the vendorâ€™s instructions for guidance.
	5- Verify full-system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures.
	6- Document the findings, lessons learned, actions, and outcomes.

-------------------------------------------------
Identify the Problem 1.2.2
-Gather Information from the User
	- What are the exact error messages appearing on the screen or coming from the speaker?
	- Is anyone else experiencing the same problem?
	- How long has the problem been occurring?
	- What changes have been made recently to the system? Were these changes initiated by you or via another support request?
	- If something worked previously, then experiences mechanical failures, are there any changes made by the user or from environmental or infrastructure change?
	- Have you tried anything to solve the problem?

- Perform Backups
	- Check when a backup was last made


---------------------------------------------------------
Establish and Test a Theory 1.2.3
- Conduct Research

---------------------------------------------------------
Question the Obvious 1.2.4
- step-by-step on what should happen 
- observing the user 
- break the troubleshooting process into compartments or categories
	- such as power, hardware components, drivers/firmware, software, network, and user actions

------------------------------------------------------------
Establish a New Theory or Escalate 1.2.5
- Choosing whether to escalate a problem is complex because you must balance the need to resolve a problem in a timely fashion against the possibility of incurring additional costs or adding to the burdens that senior staff are already coping with. You should be guided by policies and practices in the company you work for. When you escalate a problem, make sure that what you have found out or attempted so far is documented. After that, describe the problem clearly to whoever takes over or provides you with assistance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Implement a Plan of Action 1.2.6
- next steps to solve the problem
- There are typically three generic approaches to resolving an IT problem:
	- Repair: You need to determine whether the cost of repair makes this the best option.
	- Replace: This is often more expensive and may be time-consuming if a part is not available. There may also be an opportunity to upgrade the part or software.
	- Workaround: Not all problems are critical. If neither repair nor replacement is cost-effective, it may be best to either find a workaround or just document the issue and move on.

- Establish a Plan of Action
- Implement the Solution
	- made notes on what you did 
- Refer to Vendor Instructions 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Verify and Document 1.2.7
-  test that it fixes the reported problem and that the system as a whole continues to function normally
	- Trying to use a component or performing the activity that prompted the problem report
	- Inspecting a component to see whether it is properly connected or damaged or whether any status or indicator lights show a problem
	- Disabling or uninstalling the component (if it might be the cause of a wider problem)
	- Consulting logs and software tools to confirm a component is configured properly
	- Updating software or a device driver
- Implement Preventive Measures
- Document Findings, Lessons Learned, Actions, and Outcomes
