Display Types 2.1.8

	- In-Plane Switching (IPS): A type of liquid crystal display technology where the liquid crystals are aligned parallel to the screen, allowing for consistent light transmission and color reproduction.
		- Pros: Superior color accuracy and wide viewing angles, making them ideal for graphic design and professional use.
		- Cons: Typically, slower response times compared to TN panels, which may affect fast-paced gaming.
	
	-Twisted Nematic (TN): A type of liquid crystal display technology where the liquid crystals twist 90 degrees between the electrodes to control light passage and create images on the screen.
		-Pros: Faster response times and higher refresh rates, which are preferred for gaming.
		-Cons: Poorer color reproduction and limited viewing angles.

	-Vertical Alignment (VA): A type of liquid crystal display technology where the liquid crystals are aligned vertically to the glass substrates and tilt when voltage is applied to control light passage and create images.
		- Pros: Better color accuracy and viewing angles than TN.
		- Cons: Slower response times than TN but better than IPS in some cases. VA panels can exhibit color shifting when viewed from extreme angles.

	- Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED):display is a type of display technology where each pixel emits its own light through organic compounds when an electric current is applied.
		- Pros: Excellent color accuracy, contrast ratios, energy efficiency, and true blacks due to self-emissive pixels.
		- Cons: Potential for burn-in, where static images can leave permanent marks if displayed for long periods.

	- Mini-LED Technology: display is a type of display technology that uses thousands of tiny LEDs for backlighting, allowing for more precise control of brightness and contrast in the image.
		- Pros: Mini-LED technology offers improved brightness, better contrast and black levels, enhanced color accuracy, and reduced halo effect, allowing for thin and lightweight display designs suitable for a variety of applications.
		- Cons: Mini-LED displays are more expensive, can consume more power than OLEDs, and while they reduce blooming, they do not achieve the true blacks of OLED technology and add complexity to the manufacturing process.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Display Components 2.1.9

-  Touch Screens and Digitizers:
	- Integral for interactive displays, allowing direct interaction through touch or stylus. This is common in smartphones, tablets, and some laptops.

- Inverter:
	- Crucial in older LCDs for converting DC power to AC for the backlight. Modern displays with LED backlighting typically do not require an inverter.

- Pixel Density: 
	-Higher density results in sharper images.

- Refresh Rates: 
	- Higher rates (measured in Hz) provide smoother motion, which is important for gaming and video playback.

- Screen Resolution: 
	-Defines clarity and detail of the display. Common resolutions include:
	- Full HD (1920x1080)
	- Quad HD (2560x1440)
	- 4K (3840x2160)
	- Newer Resolutions: 5K (5120x2880) and 8K (7680x4320) are emerging, offering even higher clarity and detail.

- Color Gamut:
	- Refers to the range of colors a display can produce based on the RGB color model. A wider color gamut allows for more vibrant and accurate color reproduction, enhancing the visual experience for activities such as photo editing, video production, and gaming. Common color gamuts include sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3, with DCI-P3 offering a broader range of colors compared to sRGB. Additionally, color depth plays a crucial role, with 24-bit color (often referred to as true color) supporting approximately 16.7 million colors, while 32-bit color includes an alpha channel for transparency, providing even more detailed color representation and smoother gradients.

- Video Cable Bandwidth
	- Video cable bandwidth is determined by two main factors:
		- Resolution: Measured in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080 for Full HD, 3840x2160 for 4K).
		- Refresh Rate: Measured in hertz (Hz) or frames per second (fps).

2. Install the I/O Shield 
	- If your motherboard doesn't come with a pre-installed I/O shield, align the shield with the rear I/O ports and snap it into place in the case.

3. Insert Standoffs
	- Place standoffs in the case to match the mounting holes on the motherboard. Ensure that standoffs are only positioned where the motherboard has corresponding holes to avoid short circuits

4. Pre-install the CPU and Memory (Optional but recommended)
	- Install the CPU, memory, and CPU cooler on the motherboard before securing the board in the case. This provides easier access and reduces the risk of damage.

5. Align and Secure the Motherboard
	- Carefully place the motherboard onto the standoffs, aligning it with the I/O shield and ensuring all standoffs line up with the holes.
	- Secure the motherboard with the appropriate screws, ensuring it is firm and stable without overtightening.
	
6. Final Assembly
	- Connect power supplies, disk drives, and any additional adapter cards to the motherboard.
	- Attach all necessary data and power connectors.

7. Cable Management 
	- Plan and route cables neatly to maintain airflow and prevent clutter inside the case.

- Drive (HDD) activity lights
	- Show when an internal hard disk is being accessed. The corresponding connector is usually labeled "HDD LED" or similar on the motherboard.

- Audio ports
	- Allow speakers and/or headphones and a microphone to be connected. The front panel audio ports typically connect to the motherboard via an HD Audio header, often labeled "HD Audio" (or "AC'97" for older systems).

- USB ports
	- Internal USB 2 connections are made via 9-pin headers. These headers can support up to two 4-pin USB ports, with the 9th pin used for correct cable orientation. USB 3 headers use a 20-pin (2x10) format and can connect to two USB 3.x ports, supporting faster data transfer rates compared to USB 2.0.


Power Connectors
- Main Power Connector
	- The primary P1 motherboard power connector is a distinctive 24-pin block (2 rows of 12 pins) with square pin receptacles.

- Fan Connectors
	- 3-pin Molex KK format connectors: Typically used for fans, these connectors control fan speed by varying the voltage.
	- 4-pin fan Molex KK format connectors: These support precise fan-speed control via pulse width modulation (PWM), with the PWM signal carried by the blue wire. There will be one for the CPU and one or more for case fans and components such as memory and video adapters.
