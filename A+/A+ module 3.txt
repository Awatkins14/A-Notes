Module 3 Study Materials
---------------------------------------------------------
Power Supply Units 3.1.1

- power supply unit (PSU) 
	- The power supply unit (PSU) delivers low-voltage direct current (DC) power to PC components
	- It contains a rectifier to convert alternating current (AC) from the building to DC voltage, transformers to step down to lower voltages, and regulators to ensure consistent output with filters and regulators. 

- low line (120 VAC)  and high line (230 VAC) 
- AC voltage supply varies by country and distribution circuits, so PSUs have a wide tolerance range: 100-127 VAC for low-line and 220-240 VAC for high-line.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Lab: Install a Power Supply 3.1.2

- You are the IT administrator for a small corporate network. You are repairing the computer in the IT Administration Office, which appears to have a failed power supply. After testing the power supply and confirming the failure, you removed it from the computer. Now, you need to select a replacement power supply.

- In this lab, your task is to:

- Install a power supply:
	- The power supply must have the appropriate power connectors for the motherboard and the CPU. Consult the motherboard documentation to see its power requirements.
	- The power supply must support adding a graphics card that requires its own power connector.
	- In the sim, the power supply is seated just below the motherboard.
- Make the following connections from the power supply:
	- Connect the motherboard power connector.
	- Connect the CPU power connector.
	- Connect the power connectors for the SATA hard drives.
Start the computer:
	- Plug the computer in using the existing cable plugged into the power strip.
	- Turn on the power supply using the switch on the back.
	- Turn on the computer and boot into Windows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wattage Rating 3.1.3

- Power (Watts) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)
- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) must provide enough wattage for all components combined.
- Typical PSU Wattage:
	- Standard desktop: 400–500 W
	- Gaming PCs: 600 W or more
	- Enterprise servers/workstations: >1000 W

- Problems from an Underpowered PSU
- System Instability: random shutdowns, reboots, crashes
- Component Damage: PSU overheating → can harm itself or other parts

- Power Distribution (Rails)
- A rail is a wire carrying current at a specific voltage.
- Modern systems mainly use the +12 V rail, since it powers CPU and GPU.
	- Output Rail (VDC)	Max Load (A)	Max Output (W)
	+3.3 V			20		130
	+5 V			20		130
	+12 V			33		396
	-12 V			0.8		9.6
	+5 V (standby)		2.5		12.5

	- Note:+3.3 V and +5 V rails often share a combined power limit.
	- The +12 V rail is the most critical for modern systems.

- Energy Efficiency
	- Efficiency = how much of the wall power (AC) becomes usable DC power.
	- Example:
		- 300 W PSU @ 75% efficiency = draws 400 W, wastes 100 W as heat.
		- More heat = more cooling needed = higher energy cost.

	- 80 PLUS Efficiency Ratings
	Rating		20% Load	50% Load	100% Load	Notes
	Bronze		82%		85%		82%		Entry-level efficiency
	Silver		85%		88%		85%		Moderate efficiency
	Gold		87%		90%		87%		Common in gaming PCs
	Platinum	90%		92%		89%		High efficiency
	Titanium	90% @10%	92%		94%		90%
	
	-ENERGY STAR 80 PLUS PSUs must be ≥80% efficient at 20–100% load.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Supply Connectors 3.1.4

- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) sends DC voltage to all computer components.
- Common voltage levels:
	- +3.3 VDC
	- +5 VDC
	- +12 VDC
- Voltage regulators ensure each component gets the correct amount of power.

- P1 Connector = 24-pin ATX power connector
	- Supplies main power to the motherboard.
	- Earlier systems used a 20-pin version (still backward compatible with adapters).
	- Provides +3.3 V, +5 V, +12 V, and ground connections.

- PCIe (Graphics Card) Power Connectors
	- Supply extra power to GPUs (beyond what the PCIe slot gives).
	- Common types:
		- 6-pin PCIe = up to 75 W
		- 8-pin PCIe = up to 150 W
		- 16-pin (new 12VHPWR for PCIe 5.0 GPUs) = up to 600 W
	- Tip: Always match the connector type to the GPU’s requirement to avoid underpowering it.

- Drive Power Connectors
- Molex Connector
	- 4-pin connector used for older devices like:
		- IDE hard drives
		- Optical drives
		- Some case fans
	- Provides +12 V and +5 V

- SATA Power Connector
	- Slim, 15-pin connector for modern drives (HDDs, SSDs, optical drives).
	- Provides +3.3 V, +5 V, and +12 V.

- Key Notes
	- Always ensure the connector type and voltage rating match the device.
	- Never force a connector it should fit easily.
	- Incorrect connections can cause damage to components or the PSU.

----------------------------------------------------------
20-pin to 24-pin Motherboard Adapter 3.1.5
- ATX PSU Standards
	- The ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) power supply standard has gone through multiple revisions.
	- These updates changed the main motherboard connector design to support newer hardware with higher power needs.


- Original ATX Connector (20-pin)
	- Early ATX motherboards used a 20-pin (2×10) P1 connector.
	- Wire color coding:
		- Yellow = +12 V
		- Red = +5 V
		- Orange = +3.3 V
		- Black = Ground
	- Tip: The 20-pin connector supplied enough power for older CPUs, RAM, and expansion cards.

- Modern ATX Connector (24-pin)
	- Modern motherboards use a 24-pin (2×12) P1 connector.
	- The extra 4 pins provide additional +12 V, +5 V, and +3.3 V power lines for newer components that draw more power (like PCIe slots and extra memory).

- 20+4-pin Compatibility
	- Many modern PSUs include a 20+4-pin adapter:
		- The extra 4 pins can detach to fit older 20-pin motherboards.
		- When combined, it becomes a full 24-pin connector for newer boards.
	- Purpose: Ensures backward compatibility between old and new motherboards.

Key Notes
	- Always check the motherboard manual for the required connector type.
	- Never force a 24-pin connector into a 20-pin socket that doesn’t support it.
	- Using the proper adapter ensures stable power delivery and prevents system damage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modular Power Supplies 3.1.6
- Overview
	- A modular PSU has detachable power cables, allowing you to connect only the cables your system needs.
	- This contrasts with a non-modular PSU, where all cables are permanently attached.

- Benefits of Modular PSUs
	- Reduced Clutter
		- Only necessary cables are used, which keeps the interior tidy.
	- Improved Airflow
		- Fewer cables mean less obstruction for case fans and airflow.
	- Better Cooling
		- Reduced cable clutter improves overall system cooling efficiency.

- Example
	- A non-modular PSU may have 4–5 Molex/SATA connectors, but your PC may only use 2.
	- With a modular PSU, you can remove unused cables, reducing clutter and improving airflow.

- Key Notes
	- Modular PSUs are especially useful in gaming PCs, high-performance builds, and compact cases.
	- Some high-end PSUs are fully modular (all cables detachable), while others are semi-modular (essential cables like 24-pin ATX and CPU power remain attached).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundant Power Supplies 3.1.7
- Overview
	- Redundant PSUs are used to maintain system uptime and prevent data loss, especially in enterprise environments.
	- Systems may have two PSUs:
		- Primary PSU: powers the system normally.
		- Redundant/failover PSU: automatically takes over if the primary fails.
- Purpose & Benefits
	- Continuous Operation
		- Essential in data centers and high-availability systems.
	- Data Protection
		- Minimizes the risk of data loss during PSU failure.
	- System Reliability
		- Keeps servers running even during power failures or PSU malfunctions.

-  Server Implementation
	- PSUs connect to a backplane, which is a circuit board providing electrical connections between components.
	- Hot-swappable PSUs:
		- Faulty PSU can be replaced without shutting down the system.
		- Critical for maintaining uptime and ensuring services remain available.

- Desktop vs Server Use
	- Desktops: Rarely use redundant PSUs because continuous uptime is less critical.
	- Servers/Enterprise systems: Standard feature due to need for reliability and data integrity.

- Redundant PSUs are a key topic for enterprise hardware setups—remember their role in hot-swapping and failover scenarios.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lab: Troubleshoot Power Supply Problems 3.1.9

- You've received a service request from an employee experiencing a critical issue where their system shuts down unexpectedly before it can fully boot.

Fan Cooling Systems 3.1.10
- Overview
	- Computer components generate heat due to electrical resistance.
	- Excessive heat can:
		- Damage components
		- Cause system instability or crashes
	- CPUs are particularly sensitive to overheating.
	- Note: Other components like RAM, GPUs, and chipsets also need cooling.

- Purpose of Fan Cooling
	- Dissipate Heat
		- Moves hot air away from components.
	- Maintain Safe Operating Temperatures
		- Keeps CPUs, GPUs, and other devices within manufacturer-specified thermal limits.
	- Prevent Malfunctions
		- Reduces risk of crashes or permanent hardware damage.

- Key Points
	- Intel and AMD improve CPU thermal efficiency, but all CPUs require active cooling.
	- Fans are a cost-effective and common cooling solution.
	- Proper airflow in the case is important:
	- Intake fans bring in cool air
	- Exhaust fans remove hot air

- For high-performance PCs or servers, additional fans or alternative cooling (like liquid cooling) may be necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heat Sinks and Thermal Paste 3.1.11

- Overview
	- Heat sinks help dissipate heat from components to prevent overheating.
	- Two types:
		- Passive Heat Sinks
		- Active Heat Sinks
- Passive Heat Sinks
	- Also called heat spreaders.
	- Used by: memory modules (RAM), some chipsets.
	- Characteristics:
		- No fan
		- Rely on increased surface area and natural airflow to cool components

Active Heat Sinks
	- Used by: CPUs, high-end GPUs, some integrated graphics chipsets.
	- Components:
		- Metal block (copper or aluminum)	
		- Fins for increased surface area
		- Fan for forced air convection
	- Attachment: mounted to the component using thermal paste or thermal pads to eliminate air gaps for efficient heat transfer.

- Thermal Paste vs Thermal Pads
	Feature			Thermal Paste			Thermal Pad
	Heat Transfer		High efficiency			Moderate
	Ease of Application	Requires careful application	Easier to apply
	Reliability		Long-lasting if applied correctly	May degrade faster
	- Thermal paste is generally preferred for CPUs due to better heat conductivity.

- CPU Heat Sink Installation
	- Attached to CPU socket on the motherboard.
	- Secured using:
		- Retaining clips
		- Push pins (release/reset with a half-turn of a screwdriver)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fans 3.1.12
- Overview
	- Fans are used to improve airflow and dissipate heat that passive heat sinks cannot handle.
	- Found in:
		- Power supplies
		- Chassis exhaust points
		- Heat sinks (most CPU/GPU heat sinks have fans)

- Airflow and Cooling
	- Cool air is drawn from front vents; warm air is expelled through back vents.
	- Chassis designs may include:
		- Plastic shrouds or baffles to direct airflow over the CPU
		- Clips to secure airflow channels
	- Tip: Proper airflow is essential—minimize cable clutter and cover unused expansion slots with blanking plates.

- Fan Control & Monitoring
	- Fans connect to motherboard fan power ports.
	- Thermometer sensors at each fan location:
		- Set appropriate fan speeds
		- Detect fan failures

- Maintenance
	- Fans and heat sinks lose effectiveness if dust accumulates.
	- Clean regularly using:
		- Soft brush
		- Compressed air
		- PC-approved vacuum cleaner
	- Tip: Regular cleaning improves cooling efficiency and prolongs component lifespan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liquid Cooling Systems  3.1.13

- Overview
	- Used in high-end gaming PCs, workstations, or PCs in high ambient temperatures.
	- Pumps coolant (usually water) through the system for more effective cooling than air alone.
	- Often quieter than multiple fans.

- Open-Loop Liquid Cooling Components
	- Water Loop / Tubing and Pump
		- Circulates coolant through the system via a reservoir.
	- Water Blocks and Brackets
		- Attached to components (CPU, GPU, etc.)
		- Remove heat by convection, similar to heat sink/fan assemblies
		- Connected to the water loop
	- Radiators and Fans
		- Positioned at air vents to expel heat from the liquid coolant
	- Tip: Think of water blocks as a “liquid heat sink” transferring heat to the radiator.

- Closed-Loop (All-In-One) Systems
	- Pre-assembled for single components (CPU or GPU)
	- Easier to install and maintain than open-loop systems
	- Typically maintenance-free for standard use

- Exam Tip:
	- Open-loop = customizable, supports multiple components, requires maintenance.
	- Closed-loop (AIO) = simpler, single-component cooling, mostly maintenance-free.
