Module 3 Study Materials
---------------------------------------------------------
Power Supply Units 3.1.1

- power supply unit (PSU) 
	- The power supply unit (PSU) delivers low-voltage direct current (DC) power to PC components
	- It contains a rectifier to convert alternating current (AC) from the building to DC voltage, transformers to step down to lower voltages, and regulators to ensure consistent output with filters and regulators. 

- low line (120 VAC)  and high line (230 VAC) 
- AC voltage supply varies by country and distribution circuits, so PSUs have a wide tolerance range: 100-127 VAC for low-line and 220-240 VAC for high-line.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Lab: Install a Power Supply 3.1.2

- You are the IT administrator for a small corporate network. You are repairing the computer in the IT Administration Office, which appears to have a failed power supply. After testing the power supply and confirming the failure, you removed it from the computer. Now, you need to select a replacement power supply.

- In this lab, your task is to:

- Install a power supply:
	- The power supply must have the appropriate power connectors for the motherboard and the CPU. Consult the motherboard documentation to see its power requirements.
	- The power supply must support adding a graphics card that requires its own power connector.
	- In the sim, the power supply is seated just below the motherboard.
- Make the following connections from the power supply:
	- Connect the motherboard power connector.
	- Connect the CPU power connector.
	- Connect the power connectors for the SATA hard drives.
Start the computer:
	- Plug the computer in using the existing cable plugged into the power strip.
	- Turn on the power supply using the switch on the back.
	- Turn on the computer and boot into Windows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wattage Rating 3.1.3

- Power (Watts) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)
- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) must provide enough wattage for all components combined.
- Typical PSU Wattage:
	- Standard desktop: 400–500 W
	- Gaming PCs: 600 W or more
	- Enterprise servers/workstations: >1000 W

- Problems from an Underpowered PSU
- System Instability: random shutdowns, reboots, crashes
- Component Damage: PSU overheating → can harm itself or other parts

- Power Distribution (Rails)
- A rail is a wire carrying current at a specific voltage.
- Modern systems mainly use the +12 V rail, since it powers CPU and GPU.
	- Output Rail (VDC)	Max Load (A)	Max Output (W)
	+3.3 V			20		130
	+5 V			20		130
	+12 V			33		396
	-12 V			0.8		9.6
	+5 V (standby)		2.5		12.5

	- Note:+3.3 V and +5 V rails often share a combined power limit.
	- The +12 V rail is the most critical for modern systems.

- Energy Efficiency
	- Efficiency = how much of the wall power (AC) becomes usable DC power.
	- Example:
		- 300 W PSU @ 75% efficiency = draws 400 W, wastes 100 W as heat.
		- More heat = more cooling needed = higher energy cost.

	- 80 PLUS Efficiency Ratings
	Rating		20% Load	50% Load	100% Load	Notes
	Bronze		82%		85%		82%		Entry-level efficiency
	Silver		85%		88%		85%		Moderate efficiency
	Gold		87%		90%		87%		Common in gaming PCs
	Platinum	90%		92%		89%		High efficiency
	Titanium	90% @10%	92%		94%		90%
	
	-ENERGY STAR 80 PLUS PSUs must be ≥80% efficient at 20–100% load.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Supply Connectors 3.1.4

- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) sends DC voltage to all computer components.
- Common voltage levels:
	- +3.3 VDC
	- +5 VDC
	- +12 VDC
- Voltage regulators ensure each component gets the correct amount of power.

- P1 Connector = 24-pin ATX power connector
	- Supplies main power to the motherboard.
	- Earlier systems used a 20-pin version (still backward compatible with adapters).
	- Provides +3.3 V, +5 V, +12 V, and ground connections.

- PCIe (Graphics Card) Power Connectors
	- Supply extra power to GPUs (beyond what the PCIe slot gives).
	- Common types:
		- 6-pin PCIe = up to 75 W
		- 8-pin PCIe = up to 150 W
		- 16-pin (new 12VHPWR for PCIe 5.0 GPUs) = up to 600 W
	- Tip: Always match the connector type to the GPU’s requirement to avoid underpowering it.

- Drive Power Connectors
- Molex Connector
	- 4-pin connector used for older devices like:
		- IDE hard drives
		- Optical drives
		- Some case fans
	- Provides +12 V and +5 V

- SATA Power Connector
	- Slim, 15-pin connector for modern drives (HDDs, SSDs, optical drives).
	- Provides +3.3 V, +5 V, and +12 V.

- Key Notes
	- Always ensure the connector type and voltage rating match the device.
	- Never force a connector it should fit easily.
	- Incorrect connections can cause damage to components or the PSU.

----------------------------------------------------------
20-pin to 24-pin Motherboard Adapter 3.1.5
- ATX PSU Standards
	- The ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) power supply standard has gone through multiple revisions.
	- These updates changed the main motherboard connector design to support newer hardware with higher power needs.


- Original ATX Connector (20-pin)
	- Early ATX motherboards used a 20-pin (2×10) P1 connector.
	- Wire color coding:
		- Yellow = +12 V
		- Red = +5 V
		- Orange = +3.3 V
		- Black = Ground
	- Tip: The 20-pin connector supplied enough power for older CPUs, RAM, and expansion cards.

- Modern ATX Connector (24-pin)
	- Modern motherboards use a 24-pin (2×12) P1 connector.
	- The extra 4 pins provide additional +12 V, +5 V, and +3.3 V power lines for newer components that draw more power (like PCIe slots and extra memory).

- 20+4-pin Compatibility
	- Many modern PSUs include a 20+4-pin adapter:
		- The extra 4 pins can detach to fit older 20-pin motherboards.
		- When combined, it becomes a full 24-pin connector for newer boards.
	- Purpose: Ensures backward compatibility between old and new motherboards.

Key Notes
	- Always check the motherboard manual for the required connector type.
	- Never force a 24-pin connector into a 20-pin socket that doesn’t support it.
	- Using the proper adapter ensures stable power delivery and prevents system damage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modular Power Supplies 3.1.6
- Overview
	- A modular PSU has detachable power cables, allowing you to connect only the cables your system needs.
	- This contrasts with a non-modular PSU, where all cables are permanently attached.

- Benefits of Modular PSUs
	- Reduced Clutter
		- Only necessary cables are used, which keeps the interior tidy.
	- Improved Airflow
		- Fewer cables mean less obstruction for case fans and airflow.
	- Better Cooling
		- Reduced cable clutter improves overall system cooling efficiency.

- Example
	- A non-modular PSU may have 4–5 Molex/SATA connectors, but your PC may only use 2.
	- With a modular PSU, you can remove unused cables, reducing clutter and improving airflow.

- Key Notes
	- Modular PSUs are especially useful in gaming PCs, high-performance builds, and compact cases.
	- Some high-end PSUs are fully modular (all cables detachable), while others are semi-modular (essential cables like 24-pin ATX and CPU power remain attached).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundant Power Supplies 3.1.7
- Overview
	- Redundant PSUs are used to maintain system uptime and prevent data loss, especially in enterprise environments.
	- Systems may have two PSUs:

		- Redundant/failover PSU: automatically takes over if the primary fails.
- Purpose & Benefits
	- Continuous Operation
		- Essential in data centers and high-availability systems.
	- Data Protection
		- Minimizes the risk of data loss during PSU failure.
	- System Reliability
		- Keeps servers running even during power failures or PSU malfunctions.

-  Server Implementation
	- PSUs connect to a backplane, which is a circuit board providing electrical connections between components.
	- Hot-swappable PSUs:
		- Faulty PSU can be replaced without shutting down the system.
		- Critical for maintaining uptime and ensuring services remain available.

- Desktop vs Server Use
	- Desktops: Rarely use redundant PSUs because continuous uptime is less critical.
	- Servers/Enterprise systems: Standard feature due to need for reliability and data integrity.

- Redundant PSUs are a key topic for enterprise hardware setups—remember their role in hot-swapping and failover scenarios.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		- Plastic shrouds or baffles to direct airflow over the CPU
		- Clips to secure airflow channels
	- Tip: Proper airflow is essential—minimize cable clutter and cover unused expansion slots with blanking plates.

- Fan Control & Monitoring
	- Fans connect to motherboard fan power ports.
	- Thermometer sensors at each fan location:
		- Set appropriate fan speeds
		- Detect fan failures

- Maintenance
	- Fans and heat sinks lose effectiveness if dust accumulates.
	- Clean regularly using:
		- Soft brush
		- Compressed air
		- PC-approved vacuum cleaner
	- Tip: Regular cleaning improves cooling efficiency and prolongs component lifespan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liquid Cooling Systems  3.1.13

- Overview
	- Used in high-end gaming PCs, workstations, or PCs in high ambient temperatures.
	- Pumps coolant (usually water) through the system for more effective cooling than air alone.
	- Often quieter than multiple fans.

- Open-Loop Liquid Cooling Components
	- Water Loop / Tubing and Pump
		- Circulates coolant through the system via a reservoir.
	- Water Blocks and Brackets
		- Attached to components (CPU, GPU, etc.)
		- Remove heat by convection, similar to heat sink/fan assemblies
		- Connected to the water loop
	- Radiators and Fans
		- Positioned at air vents to expel heat from the liquid coolant
	- Tip: Think of water blocks as a “liquid heat sink” transferring heat to the radiator.

- Closed-Loop (All-In-One) Systems
	- Pre-assembled for single components (CPU or GPU)
	- Easier to install and maintain than open-loop systems
	- Typically maintenance-free for standard use

- Exam Tip:
	- Open-loop = customizable, supports multiple components, requires maintenance.
	- Closed-loop (AIO) = simpler, single-component cooling, mostly maintenance-free.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard Disk Drives 3.2.4 

- Overview
	- HDDs store data on spinning metal or glass platters coated with a magnetic material.
	- Data is read and written by read/write heads that move across the platter surfaces.
	- Each platter spins on a spindle, and the heads move via an actuator arm.

	- Think of an HDD like a record player:
	- Platters = records, heads = needle, spindle = turntable motor.

- How It Works
	- Each platter side is divided into tracks, and each track is divided into sectors.
	- Each sector stores 512 bytes of data.
	- This structure is called drive geometry or low-level formatting.

- HDD Components
	- Platters – Store magnetic data.
	- Spindle – Spins the platters at high speeds.
	- Read/Write Heads – Magnetically read and write data.
	- Actuator Arm – Moves the heads across the platters.

- Performance Factors
	- Spindle Speed (RPM)
		- Determines how fast platters spin and affects access time.
		- Common speeds:
			- 15,000 RPM → Enterprise-grade, ~180 MB/s transfer rate
			- 10,000 RPM → High-performance
			- 7,200 RPM → Standard desktop drives (~110 MB/s)
			- 5,400 RPM → Low-power or laptop drives

	- Access Time
		- Measured in milliseconds (ms).
		- Includes:
			-  Seek Time: Time for head to move to the correct track.
			- Access Time: Total delay before data can be read.
		- Typical values:
			- High-performance HDD: <3 ms'
			- Average HDD: ~6 ms

	- Data Transfer Rate
		- Measures how fast data moves between the platter and system.
		- Example:
			- 15,000 RPM drive: up to 180 MB/s
			- 7,200 RPM drive: around 110 MB/s

- Interfaces & Form Factors
	- Interface:
		- Most HDDs use the SATA interface (Serial ATA).

	Form Factors:
	Type		Size				Typical Use
	3.5-inch		Larger, faster, more storage	Desktops
	2.5-inch		Smaller, quieter, less power	Laptops & externals

	- 2.5-inch drives can vary in thickness:
		- 15 mm
		- 9.5 mm
		- 7 mm 
		- 5 mm

- Key Takeaways
	- HDDs use mechanical movement → slower than SSDs.
	- RPM and access time determine performance.
	- More fragile due to moving parts.
	- Still widely used for bulk storage because of low cost per GB.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundant Array of Independent Disks 3.2.5

- Overview
	- RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks.
	- Combines multiple HDDs or SSDs into one logical storage unit for better performance, fault tolerance, or both.
	- The OS sees the RAID array as one single drive.

	- Think of RAID like teamwork:
		- If one drive fails, others help keep the data safe and system running.

- Why Use RAID
	- Protects against data loss if a drive fails.
	- Can boost performance by spreading (striping) data across multiple drives.
	- Reduces downtime in case of hardware failure. 
	
	- Risk			Without RAID		With RAID
	Boot Drive Fails		System crashes		System can stay running
	Data Drive Fails		Files lost		Files can be recovered from redundancy

- RAID Implementation
	- RAID can be set up in two main ways:
	- Software RAID
		- Managed by the operating system.
		- Uses the CPU for RAID operations (slightly slower).
		- Less expensive but not as fast or reliable as hardware RAID.
	- Hardware RAID
		- Managed by a dedicated RAID controller (adapter card).
		- Drives connect to the controller’s SATA ports instead of the motherboard.
		- Often supports hot-swapping (replace failed drives without shutting down).
		- Faster and more reliable, but more costly.
	- Some motherboards include built-in RAID support in the chipset.


- Common RAID Levels
RAID Level				Description					Key Benefit
RAID 0 (Striping)								Splits data across drives	 							Best performance ⚠️ No redundancy
RAID 1 (Mirroring)								Duplicates data on two drives	 					Full redundancy ⚠️ Half capacity
RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)					Distributes data + parity across 3+ drives			Good balance of speed + protection
RAID 6 (Double Parity)							Like RAID 5 but with 2 parity blocks					 Survives 2 drive failures
RAID 10 (1+0)									Combines mirroring and striping						High speed + redundancy ⚠️ Expensive (needs 4+ drives)

- Key Terms
	- Fault Tolerance: System keeps working even if a drive fails.
	- Hot-swapping: Replacing a failed drive without turning off the system.
	- Parity: Extra data used to rebuild information if a disk fails.

- Key Takeaways
	- RAID protects data and improves performance by using multiple drives together.
	- RAID 0 = Speed, RAID 1 = Safety, RAID 5/6/10 = Best of both worlds.
	- Hardware RAID = more reliable and supports hot-swapping.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAID 0 and RAID 1 3.2.6

- Overview
	- When setting up a RAID array, the RAID level determines how data is stored, protected, and accessed.
	- Choosing the right level depends on:
		- Fault tolerance (protection from drive failure)
		- Performance (read/write speed)
		- Capacity (usable storage)
		- Cost (how many drives are needed)
	- Tip: Always use identical drives in size, type, and speed to avoid wasted space or performance bottlenecks.

- RAID 0 – Striping (No Parity)
	- How It Works
		- Splits (stripes) data evenly across two or more drives.
		- Multiple disks can read/write simultaneously, increasing speed.
		- Logical volume = sum of all drive capacities, but limited by smallest drive.

	- Advantages
		- Best read/write performance.
		- Uses 100% of total disk capacity.
		- Great for temporary or non-critical data (like cache or scratch disks).
	
	- Disadvantages
		- No redundancy – if one drive fails, all data is lost.
		- Not suitable for storing important files.

	- Requirements
		- Minimum: 2 drives

- Comparison Summary
Feature				RAID 0 (Striping)		RAID 1 (Mirroring)
Minimum Drives			2			2
Redundancy			None			Full
Performance			Very Fast		Good (faster reads)
Fault Tolerance			None			Survives 1 drive failure
Storage Efficiency		100%			50%
Best For				Gaming, temporary files	Critical data, OS drives

- Key Takeaways
	- RAID 0 = Speed only. No safety.
	- RAID 1 = Safety first. Redundant copy of data.
	- RAID 1 rebuilds quickly, while RAID 0 offers no rebuild option (data lost).
	- Always choose based on importance of data vs. performance needs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAID 5 and RAID 10 3.2.7 

- RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity)
	- Minimum Drives: 3
	- How it Works: Data is striped (split up) across all disks like RAID 0, but parity (error correction info) is also stored across all disks.
	- Fault Tolerance: Can survive 1 disk failure — lost data can be rebuilt using parity.
	- Performance:
		- Read speed: Fast (can read from multiple disks).
		- Write speed: Slower (must calculate parity).
	- Storage Efficiency: (n−1)/n — one drive’s worth of space is used for parity.
	- Example: 3 drives of 80 GB → 160 GB usable.
	- Use Case: File servers or environments needing good performance and redundancy.
	- Key Idea: RAID 5 = Fast reads + 1 drive fault tolerance + good capacity efficiency.

- RAID 10 (Stripe of Mirrors)
	- Minimum Drives: 4 (and must be even)
	- How it Works: Combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping):
		- Pairs of disks are mirrored (for safety).
		- Those mirrored pairs are striped (for speed).
	- Fault Tolerance: One disk from each mirror pair can fail — still runs fine.
	- Performance:
		- Read and Write: Very fast (no parity calculation).
	- Storage Efficiency: 50% (half of total disk space used for mirroring).
	- Use Case: Databases or critical systems needing speed and high reliability.
	- Key Idea: RAID 10 = RAID 1’s protection + RAID 0’s speed = fast & safe (but uses 50% of storage).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity) 3.2.8 

- How it Works:
	- Like RAID 5, data is striped across multiple disks.
	- Two sets of parity information are stored (instead of one), allowing the system to rebuild data even if two disks fail.

- Requirements:
	- Minimum drives: 4
	- Usable storage: Total capacity minus the size of two disks (because two are used for parity).
		- Example: 4 × 1 TB drives → 2 TB usable space
- Performance:
	- Read speed: Good (similar to RAID 5)
	- Write speed: Slower (because two parity sets must be calculated and written)

- Fault Tolerance:
	- Can survive two simultaneous disk failures — great for large or mission-critical systems.

- pros:
	- Very high fault tolerance
	- Great for big storage arrays
	- Keeps working even after one or two disk failures
- cons: 
	- Slower writes (extra parity work)
	- More expensive (needs extra disks + stronger controller)
	- Longer rebuild times

- Use Case:
	- Enterprise servers, data centers, or systems that cannot afford downtime or data loss.

- Quick Tip to Remember:
	- RAID 6 = RAID 5 + Extra Parity = Survives 2 Disk Failures

System RAM and Virtual Memory 3.3.1

- CPU Memory Hierarchy:
	- Registers → Cache → RAM → Storage (SSD/HDD)
	- CPU cache is very fast but small, so RAM supports it by storing active programs and data.

- System RAM (Random Access Memory)
	- Type: Volatile memory → loses data when power is off.
	- Speed: Faster than SSDs, much faster than HDDs.
	- Capacity: Measured in GB → affects:
		- Number of applications you can run simultaneously
		- Ability to work with large files efficiently
	- Process Execution:
		- Program/data loaded from fixed disk → RAM
		- CPU fetches instructions from RAM → Cache → Registers

- Memory Bus: Data and Address Pathways
	Pathway		Function
	Data Bus		Transfers information per clock cycle (typical: 64-bit for single channel)
	Address Bus	Tracks memory locations → limits max memory CPU can access
  
	- 32-bit CPU: 32-bit address bus → max 4 GB memory
	- 64-bit CPU:
		- Theoretical: 64-bit address space → 16 exabytes
		- Practical: Most use 48-bit address bus → max 256 TB memory
- Key Points
	- 64-bit CPUs can address more memory locations than 32-bit CPUs.
	- Data bus width (e.g., 64-bit) determines how much memory can be transferred per cycle.
	- RAM is temporary memory for running programs; storage (HDD/SSD) is permanent memory.

- Quick Tip for Exam:
	- Think of it like a pipeline: Storage feeds RAM → RAM feeds CPU cache → CPU executes instructions. 
	- More RAM = smoother multitasking and faster program execution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAM Types 3.3.2

-Modern RAM is mostly DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic RAM). RAM evolution:
-  DRAM (Dynamic RAM):
	- Stores bits as electrical charges in capacitors.
	- 1 = charged, 0 = not charged.
-  SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM):
	- Synchronized to the system clock, so memory operations align with CPU instructions.
- DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM):
	- Transfers data on both rising and falling clock edges → doubles data rate.
	- Modules labeled by peak transfer rate (e.g., PC1600, PC2100).

- DDR Calculation Example (DDR-200 / PC1600)
Step			Explanation
Clock Speed		100 MHz (memory bus & internal clock)
Data Rate		2 operations per cycle → 200 MT/s (megatransfers/sec)
Peak Transfer Rate	200 MT/s × 8 bytes/transfer = 1600 MB/s → PC1600



-DDR Generations Comparison
Type	Data Rate (MT/s)		Transfer Rate (GB/s)	Max Module Size
DDR1	200–400			1.6–3.2			1 GB
DDR2	400–1066			3.2–8.5			4 GB
DDR3	800–2133			6.4–17.066		16 GB
DDR4	1600–3200		12.8–25.6			32 GB
DDR5	4800–8000+		38.4–51.2+		128 GB+

	- MT/s: Megatransfers per second → millions of data transfers per second.
	- Transfer rate: Speed at which data is transferred by the memory controller.

- Timing and Latency
	- RAM modules have internal timings, e.g., 14-15-15-35 CAS 14.
	- CAS latency: Delay (in clock cycles) between memory controller request and data availability.
		- Lower CAS latency = faster access.
	- Important when comparing modules of the same type and speed.

- Architectural Improvements
	- DDR4:
		- Higher density → larger capacities.
		- Improved power efficiency and channel design → better throughput.
	- DDR5:
		- Dual 32-bit subchannel per DIMM → more efficient access.
		- Reduced latency and higher power efficiency.
- Quick Exam Tips:
	- DDR = Double Data Rate → 2 transfers per clock cycle.
	- DDR5 > DDR4 > DDR3 in speed, capacity, and efficiency.
	- Always check CAS latency for performance comparison.

Memory Modules 3.3.3 

- Definition:
	- A memory module is a printed circuit board holding multiple RAM chips that act as a single unit.
	- Desktop RAM: Packaged as DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Modules).
	- Laptop/Compact RAM: Packaged as SODIMMs (Small Outline DIMMs).
	- Notches on the edge connector indicate DDR generation (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5) → prevents incorrect insertion.
	- High-speed modules often include heat sinks for cooling.
	- ESD Precaution: Always handle memory modules with anti-static measures.

- DIMM vs SODIMM
	- Feature		DIMM				SODIMM
	Size			Larger				Smaller
	Use Case			Desktops, Workstations, Servers	Laptops, Mini-PCs, Compact Systems
	Capacity		Higher (up to 128+ GB with DDR5)	Lower (4–32 GB typical)
	Performance		Higher				Slightly lower
	Installation		Straight into memory slot		Insert at 45º angle into slot

- Installation & Compatibility
	- DDR type must match motherboard:
		- DDR5 → DDR5 slot only.
		- Mixing DDR types is not possible.
	- Bus Speed Consideration:
		- Use modules with the same rated speed as the motherboard.
		- Mixing speeds → system runs at slowest module speed.
	- Memory Slots:
		- Similar to expansion slots.
		- Catches at ends secure the module.
		- SODIMM slots often pop up at 45º for insertion/removal.

- Quick Exam Tips
	- Notches = DDR generation → never force a mismatch.
	- Desktop → DIMM, Laptop → SODIMM.
	- Modules with heat sinks = high-speed / high-performance RAM.
	- Anti-ESD handling is mandatory.
