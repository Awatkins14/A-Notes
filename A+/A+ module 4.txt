Module 4 
----------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.1 — BIOS and UEFI

- What Is Firmware?
	- Firmware is special program code stored on the motherboard, usually 	  in flash memory.
	  Its job is to:
		- Start and test hardware when the computer powers on
		- Prepare the system so the operating system (OS) can load
	- This startup process is called initialization.

- BIOS vs. UEFI
	- For many years, computers used BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).
	- Modern systems use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is more advanced.
	- UEFI Improvements Over BIOS
	- UEFI supports:
		- 64-bit CPU operation
		- Graphical user interface (GUI) with mouse control
		- Faster boot times
		- Networking at boot (PXE, remote diagnostics)
		- Stronger boot security (Secure Boot)
		- Ability to run in Legacy BIOS mode for compatibility
	- UEFI basically replaces BIOS but can still emulate it when needed.

- Accessing Firmware Setup
	- You enter the firmware setup screen by pressing a key when the system first powers on.
	- Common firmware access keys:
		- Esc
		- Del
		- F1
		- F2
		- F10
		- F12
	- You usually press the key when the PC logo appears.
	- Fast Boot Tip
		- Modern PCs boot very quickly.	
		- If you miss the key:
	- On Windows, Shift + Restart
	- This opens UEFI firmware settings from the recovery menu.

- Navigation and Controls
	- Legacy BIOS interface
		- Blue/black text screen
		- Keyboard only (arrow keys)
		- Esc = go back
		- F10 = save & exit (varies by system)
		- Option to load default settings
	- UEFI interface
		- Graphical menus
		- Mouse support
		- More detailed configuration options
		- Some advanced menus may still use keyboard navigation

- Visual Summary
	- BIOS
		- Text-only
		- 16-bit
		- Keyboard only
		- Older systems
		- Slower boot
	- UEFI
		- Graphical
		- 64-bit
		- Mouse support
		- Faster & more secure
		- Supports larger drives (over 2 TB)
		- Modern standard

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.3 — Boot and Device Options
	
	- The boot option sequence (also called boot priority or boot order) controls the order in which the system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) looks for a bootable device.
	- The boot device that appears first in the list is the one the system tries to load an OS from.


-Common Boot Device Types
	-1. Fixed Disk (HDD or SSD)
		- Most common boot device
		- SATA drives should ideally be connected to the lowest-numbered SATA port
		- Modern systems often use NVMe SSDs (M.2 or PCIe) as boot drives
			- Much faster than SATA SSDs
			- Usually appear in UEFI as “Windows Boot Manager” or the NVMe model name

	- 2. Optical Drive (CD / DVD / Blu-ray)
		- Used when:
			- Installing an OS from a disc
			- Repairing an existing OS
			- Running diagnostic utilities
		- Set as highest priority when you want to boot from a disc.

	- 3. USB Flash Drive
		- most modern systems allow booting from a USB that is formatted as a bootable device.
		- Common uses:
			- Installing operating systems (Windows, Linux, etc.)
			- Running recovery tools
			- BIOS/UEFI updates
		- Must be placed first in the boot order to boot from the USB.

	- 4. Network Boot / PXE (Preboot Execution Environment)
		- Allows booting from:
			- A network server
			- A network-based OS image
		- Used in:
			- Enterprise environments
			- Mass OS deployment
			- Diskless workstations
		- Boots through the network adapter, which retrieves boot files from a server.

- Configuring Boot Order
	- You can change the boot order inside the UEFI/BIOS setup under a menu commonly labeled:
		- Boot Options
		- Boot Sequence
		- Boot Priority
		- Boot Configuration
	- You can reorder devices such as:
		- Windows Boot Manager
		- NVMe SSD
		- SATA HDD/SSD
		- USB Storage Device
		- Optical Drive
		- PXE Boot Network Adapter

- CompTIA A+ Tip
	- If a computer won’t boot, always check:
		- Wrong device set as first priority
		- A USB drive is inserted and taking priority
		- The boot drive isn’t detected
	- Misconfigured boot order is one of the most common causes of “No Boot Device Found.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.4 – USB Permissions (A+ Notes)
	- What it is
	- Computer firmware (BIOS/UEFI) lets you turn hardware on or off, including USB ports.
	
	- Why it matters
		- USB ports can be a security risk, because:
			- People can plug in unauthorized USB drives
			- Malware can spread through USB devices
			- Users might copy data they should not have
		- Because of this, firmware gives you control over USB permissions.

	- What you can control
		- In the UEFI/BIOS setup screen, you may be able to:
			- Enable or disable all USB ports
			- Enable or disable specific USB ports
			- Disable USB storage only, while keeping keyboard/mouse working
			- Lock down external devices for security policies

	- Where you change it
		- You find USB permissions in the firmware setup under menus like:
			- Security
			- Advanced
			- Onboard Devices
			- Integrated Peripherals
	- Admins often disable USB ports in:
		- Schools
		- Businesses
		- Public computers
	- To prevent unauthorized access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.5 – Fan Considerations (A+ Notes)
- Why fans matter
	- Cooling fans keep the computer from overheating.
	- If dust builds up or airflow is blocked, parts can get too hot and become damaged.
	- Good maintenance
		- Clean fans regularly (dust reduces airflow).
		- Make sure airflow is balanced — about the same amount going in and out.
		- Fans should be placed so they move hot air out and cool air in (don’t push hot air downward).

- Fan Settings in BIOS/UEFI
	- You can usually control fan speeds in menus like Cooling, Power, or Advanced.
	- Common fan modes:
		- Balanced – normal cooling for everyday use
		- Cool – higher fan speed for max cooling
		- Quiet – fans run slower, system gets warmer
		- Fanless – fans off; uses passive cooling only
		- Custom – you set the speed yourself
	- Other settings
		- Minimum temperature – the temperature at which fans turn on
		- Duty cycle – how much power the fan receives (higher % = faster spin)
		- UEFI shows current temperature readings from probes near each fan

- Temperature Monitoring
	- 1. Manual Check (BIOS/UEFI)
		- Restart computer
		- Press key (F2, Del, F12, Esc, etc.)
		- Look for Monitoring or Sensors
		- Shows CPU temp and other system temps in real time
	- 2. Third-Party Apps
		- Run inside Windows
		- Use system sensors to read temperatures
		- Can warn you when the PC gets too hot
	- Examples: HWMonitor, Core Temp, Open Hardware Monitor (not required for A+ but good to know)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.6
Boot Passwords and Secure Boot

- Boot Passwords
	- Boot passwords protect the system before the operating system loads.
	- There are two main types:

	- 1. Supervisor / Administrator / Setup / BIOS Password
		- Protects access to the BIOS/UEFI setup menu.
		- Prevents people from changing system settings (boot order, security settings, etc.).
	- 2. User / System Password
		- Locks the entire computer before it boots.
		- The system will not start until the user enters the password.
		- Used mainly on servers or workstations that don’t have people logging in regularly.
	- Note:
		- If multiple people use the computer, everyone must know the password, which reduces security.
		- That’s why system passwords are mainly used on non-interactive systems (like monitoring stations).
- Secure Boot
	- Secure Boot is a UEFI security feature that stops malware from loading at startup.

	- How it works
		- The firmware checks the OS bootloader against trusted digital keys stored in UEFI.
		- If the bootloader is signed and trusted, it loads normally.
		- If the bootloader is edited, infected, or unsigned, the system blocks it from running.

	- Why Secure Boot is important
		- Protects against rootkits and boot-level malware.
		- Required by most modern operating systems.

	- Trusted keys
		- UEFI usually comes with pre-loaded keys for:
		- Microsoft Windows
		- Common Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE)
	- You can:
		- Add keys
		- Remove keys
		- Disable Secure Boot if needed (for certain OS installs or custom bootloaders)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.8
Trusted Platform Modules

- What Encryption Does
	- Encryption scrambles data so only someone with the correct decryption key can read it.
	- Keeping this key safe is extremely important.

- Hashing (Important Difference)
	- Hashing creates a unique code based on data.
	- It checks integrity (that the data hasn’t changed).
	- You cannot get the original data back from a hash.
	- Used for comparing files or verifying passwords.

- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
	- A TPM is a small hardware chip on the motherboard that securely stores:
		- Cryptographic keys
		- Digital certificates
		- Hashed passwords

	- Key Features
		- Each TPM has a unique, permanent endorsement key → this creates a “root of trust.”
		- At boot, the TPM checks hashes of:
			- Firmware
			- Bootloader
			- Operating system kernel to make sure nothing has been changed or tampered with.

- Why TPM Is Important
	- Stores keys in tamper-resistant hardware
		- Far safer than storing keys in software or files.
	- Helps secure:
		- Boot process
		- Disk encryption (like BitLocker)
		- Certificates and login data
	- Keys stored in a TPM cannot be easily extracted by malware.

- Managing a TPM
	- You can:
		- Enable
		- Disable
		- Reset (clear)
		the TPM through BIOS/UEFI.
		The OS (like Windows) also offers management tools.

- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
	- If a computer does not have a TPM, a secure USB device can be used instead.
	- An HSM is:
		- A USB thumb drive used to store encryption keys.
		- “Secure” means you must authenticate with:
			- A password
			- A PIN
			- A fingerprint

- Why Use an HSM?
	- Backup if a TPM fails
	- Move encrypted drives between computers
	- Add hardware-level key security to systems without TPM

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.10
Lab: Configure BIOS/UEFI Security
You are the IT administrator for a small corporate network. You need to configure additional security in the BIOS for the computer in Office 1.

In this lab, your task is to:

Restart the computer in the BIOS.
Press F2 while the computer is booting.
Configure the following security settings:
Add an admin password used to make changes to BIOS settings.
Password: t67xab1
Add a password that prevents hard disk access even when the hard disk is moved to another system.
Password: dog8b0b (0 is a zero)
Enable the TPM.
Enable chassis intrusion detection to show an alert during POST when an intrusion is detected.
Save your changes.
Restart the computer to verify the changes you have made.
At the bottom of the BIOS window, select Send Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart the computer if necessary.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.1
Troubleshoot Power Issues


- Why Power Matters
	- Every computer part needs steady, clean power to run.
	- If a PC won’t turn on, turns off suddenly, or randomly restarts, it is often a power problem.

- How the Power Supply Works
	- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) does three things:
		- Converts AC → DC (wall power → computer power)
		- Sends 12V power right away (fans spin, hard drive spins)
		- Tests 5V and 3.3V lines
		- If all power rails are stable, it sends a “power good” signal to the CPU so the system can start

- Basic Checks for “No Power” Problems
	- 1. Look for signs of life
		- Are LED lights on?
		- Do fans spin?
		- Do you hear the system start?
	- If nothing turns on → likely a power issue.

- Troubleshooting Steps
	- Check the surroundings
		- Make sure other devices in the room work
			- Could be a blackout or bad circuit.

- Test the wall outlet
	- Plug in a lamp or phone charger.
		-If it doesn’t work → bad outlet → call an electrician.

- Check PSU connections
	- Ensure:
		- PSU switch = ON
		- Power cable is tight
		- PSU cable is fully plugged into the motherboard

- Try a different power cable
	- The cable’s fuse or wiring might be bad.
	- Swap with a known-good cable.

- Disconnect extra devices
	- Remove:
		- Graphics card
		- Extra drives
		- Add-on cards
	- If it powers on now → PSU is underpowered or a device is faulty.

- Test the PSU
	- Use:
		- A power supply tester, or
		- A multimeter (if trained and safe)
	- IMPORTANT:
		- Never open a PSU (dangerous voltage inside).
		- Take safety precautions when testing live power.

- If the Issue Is Still Unknown
	- Then the problem is likely:
		- A bad PSU, or
		- A bad motherboard

- Watch for warning signs
	- Turn it off IMMEDIATELY if you see:
		- Smoke
		- Sparks
		- Strange smells
		- Odd noises
	- Do NOT leave a failing power supply running.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.2
Lab: Troubleshoot System Power

As an IT Administrator at a mid-sized company, your role includes monitoring and managing the Issue Trax help desk system to ensure timely resolution of reported problems.

Each ticket will include the information to determine which device is affected and the issue that needs to be resolved.

A new ticket just arrived. Do the following:

Assign the ticket to you.
Read and determine the device and problem.
Examine the hardware and resolve any issues.
Add a comment to and close the ticket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.3 Troubleshoot POST Issues

- What Is POST?
	- POST (Power-On Self-Test) is a built-in diagnostic check run by the BIOS/UEFI after the CPU receives the power good signal.
	- POST checks hardware needed to boot, such as:
		- CPU
		- RAM
		- Motherboard
		- Video adapter
		- Keyboard

- Important Note About Modern PCs
	- POST runs very fast on modern systems
	- You usually see a logo screen, not text
	- Messages appear only if there is an error

- Symptoms of POST Problems
	- You may have a POST issue if:
		- Fans spin
		- Power lights turn on
		- Screen stays blank
		- No beeps from the speaker
		- System never boots

- Steps to Troubleshoot POST Issues
	- 1. Ask what changed
		- Was the BIOS/UEFI updated recently?
		- A failed firmware update can stop POST.
	- 2. Reset the system
		- Perform a reset procedure (power off, unplug, discharge power)
	- 3. Check cables and connections
		- Make sure:
			- RAM is fully seated
			- Adapter cards are secure
			- Storage cables are connected correctly
			- A loose or backward cable can stop POST.
	- 4. Remove non-essential devices
		- Disconnect everything except:
			- CPU
			- One RAM stick
			- Motherboard
			- Video output
			- Add devices back one at a time to find the bad part.
	- 5. Check the power supply
		- Fans spinning ≠ PSU working correctly
		- PSU may fail to send the power good signal, stopping POST
	- 6. Check CPU or firmware
		- Try:
			- Replacing CPU with a known-good one (if possible)
			- Re-flashing or updating BIOS/UEFI
	- 7. Check motherboard jumpers
		- Some boards have jumpers for:
			- Recovery mode
			- CPU settings
			- Wrong jumper position = no boot

- POST Error Messages & Beep Codes
	- If POST detects a problem:
		- Error shows on screen OR
		- Error is reported with beep codes
		- Use the manufacturer’s website to confirm meanings.

- Common POST Beep Codes (IBM PC)
| Beep Code                 | Meaning                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **1 short beep**          | Normal POST (system OK)              |
| **2 short beeps**         | POST error (check screen)            |
| **No beep**               | PSU, motherboard, or speaker problem |
| **Continuous beep**       | RAM or memory controller issue       |
| **Repeating short beeps** | PSU or motherboard problem           |
| **1 long, 1 short**       | Motherboard error                    |
| **1 long, 2–3 short**     | Video adapter error                  |
| **3 long beeps**          | Keyboard issue (stuck key)           |

- Keyboard POST Issues
	- Some PCs won’t boot if a key is stuck
	- Check:
		- Nothing resting on keyboard
		- No dust or liquid inside
	- Clean using:
		- Compressed air
		- Approved cleaning swabs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.4

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.8 Troubleshoot OS Errors and Crash Screens

* **What Happens at This Stage of Boot**

  * A boot device **has already been found**
  * Boot sector code loads into memory
  * Control is handed from firmware to the operating system
  * Errors at this point are usually:

    * **Software-related**
    * **Driver-related**
    * Not usually basic hardware failures

---

### **Common Causes of OS Errors**

    * **System log**
    * Source: **BugCheck**
  * Look for:

    * First hexadecimal error code (example: `0x0A`)
  * Search the code online to identify the cause

* **3. Analyze memory dump (if available)**

  * Systems with support contracts may:

    * Generate memory dump files
    * Allow deeper analysis by support teams

* **4. Identify recent changes**

  * New drivers?
  * New hardware?
  * Recent updates?
  * Roll back changes if needed

---

### **Crash Screens on Other Operating Systems**

4.2.10
Lab: Troubleshoot Drive Availability
You work at a computer repair store. A customer has just bought a used computer at a very good price. The previous owner said the computer worked, but when it was brought home, the computer would not start.

In this lab, your task is to diagnose and correct the problems preventing this system from booting into Windows.

You'll know that you've successfully corrected all the problems when:

The computer recognizes all the components in the BIOS.
The computer boots to Windows.
Keep in mind the following when working on the system:

The computer was in use and working previously.
The previous owner mentioned that he replaced the hard drive when preparing to sell the computer.
The new owner of the computer wants the machine to boot into Windows every time to avoid any possible issues in the future.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.11 Troubleshoot Drive Reliability and Performance

* **Built-In Drive Diagnostics (S.M.A.R.T.)**

  * Most fixed disks support **S.M.A.R.T.**

    * Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology
  * Purpose:

    * Monitors drive health
    * Alerts OS if failure is predicted
  * If you suspect:

    * Drive failure
    * Slow performance

    * SpeedFan (shows S.M.A.R.T. attributes)

---

### **Performance Metrics**

* Diagnostic tests can report:

  * **IOPS** (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
* Interpreting results:

  * Lower than vendor baseline → **drive likely faulty**
  * Similar to baseline → issue may be elsewhere

---

### **Other Causes of Poor Drive Performance**

* **System Load**

  * Too many applications running
  * CPU or RAM bottlenecks

* **File Fragmentation (HDD only)**

4.2.12 Troubleshoot RAID Failure

* **What Is RAID?**

  * RAID = **Redundant Array of Independent Disks**
  * Purpose:

    * Protect data if **one disk fails**
    * Improve reliability and/or performance
  * Data protection methods:

    * **Mirroring** (duplicate data)
    * **Parity** (recovery data spread across disks)
  * RAID can be:

    * **Hardware-based** (RAID controller)
    * **Software-based** (operating system feature)
  * RAID appears to the OS as:

    * One logical **volume**
    * Can be partitioned and formatted like a normal drive

---

### **Important RAID Note**

* **RAID 0**

  * Has **NO redundancy**
  * If **one disk fails → entire volume fails**
  * Used when **speed > reliability**

---

### **Common RAID Failure Scenarios**

#### **1. Device Failure (Single Disk Failure)**

* Symptoms:

  * Volume marked as **Degraded**
  * Data is still accessible
  * System can still boot (if bootable RAID)
* Action:

  * Replace failed disk **as soon as possible**

---

#### **2. Array Failure**

* Occurs when:

  * More disks fail than RAID level allows
  * Example:

    * RAID 5 usually tolerates **one disk failure**
* Result:

  * Volume becomes unavailable
  * Boot volume failure = OS will not start

---

### **Hot Swapping & Rebuilding**

* **Hot Swapping**

  * Replace a failed disk **while system is running**
  * Only supported on compatible systems
  * Failed disks are usually marked by:

    * **Red LED**

⚠ **WARNING**

* Never remove a healthy disk

* Removing the wrong disk can cause total array failure

* Always back up data first

* **Rebuilding the Array**

  * After inserting replacement disk:

    * Use RAID utility to rebuild
    * Hardware RAID → Controller utility
    * Software RAID → OS utility
  * During rebuild:

    * Performance will be **severely reduced**
    * Large amounts of data are rewritten

---

### **Troubleshooting RAID Problems**

#### **Unavailable Volume / “Array Missing”**

* Causes:

  * Too many failed disks
  * RAID controller failure
* If boot volume is affected:

  * OS will not load
* Solution:

  * Restore from backup
  * Attempt file recovery if possible

---

#### **Controller Failure**

* Symptoms:

  * RAID utility not accessible
  * Boot errors related to RAID
* Data recovery:

  * Usually possible
  * Some file corruption may occur
* Fix:

  * Replace controller
  * Import disks into another compatible system

---

#### **Boot Process Issues**

* Use:

  * RAID configuration utility during boot
* If utility cannot be accessed:

  * Controller likely failed

---

### **Exam Tips**

* RAID ≠ backup
* RAID 0 = no fault tolerance
* Degraded = still working but vulnerable
* Rebuilds hurt performance
* Never hot-swap a healthy disk

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.4 Troubleshoot Performance Issues

Performance issues are difficult to diagnose because **many different factors** can cause a system to feel slow. Always use a **structured, step-by-step approach**.

---

### **1. Check for Overheating**

* High temperatures cause components to **throttle** (slow down) to prevent damage
* Common symptoms:

  * Sluggish performance
  * Random slowdowns
  * Loud or constantly running fans
* Actions:

  * Monitor **CPU and system temperatures**
  * Check **fan speeds**

  * Date/time resets after shutdown
  * BIOS/UEFI clock is incorrect
* Solution:

  * Replace the battery with the **same type** (usually CR2032)

---

### **CMOS vs Modern Systems**

* The RTC battery is often called the **CMOS battery**
* Older systems stored configuration data in **CMOS RAM**
* Modern systems store settings in:

  * **NVRAM**
  * **Flash memory**
* Today, the battery mainly supports the **RTC**, not system settings

---

### **Network Time Synchronization**

* Modern systems often use **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**
* NTP automatically syncs the system clock with network time servers
* Helps keep time accurate even after restarts

---

### **Exam Tips**

* Wrong time after power-off = **bad RTC/CMOS battery**
* Replace with **CR2032**
* RTC keeps time when system is off
* NTP keeps clocks accurate on networks
