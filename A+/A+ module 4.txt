Module 4 
----------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.1 — BIOS and UEFI

- What Is Firmware?
	- Firmware is special program code stored on the motherboard, usually 	  in flash memory.
	  Its job is to:
		- Start and test hardware when the computer powers on
		- Prepare the system so the operating system (OS) can load
	- This startup process is called initialization.

- BIOS vs. UEFI
	- For many years, computers used BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).
	- Modern systems use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is more advanced.
	- UEFI Improvements Over BIOS
	- UEFI supports:
		- 64-bit CPU operation
		- Graphical user interface (GUI) with mouse control
		- Faster boot times
		- Networking at boot (PXE, remote diagnostics)
		- Stronger boot security (Secure Boot)
		- Ability to run in Legacy BIOS mode for compatibility
	- UEFI basically replaces BIOS but can still emulate it when needed.

- Accessing Firmware Setup
	- You enter the firmware setup screen by pressing a key when the system first powers on.
	- Common firmware access keys:
		- Esc
		- Del
		- F1
		- F2
		- F10
		- F12
	- You usually press the key when the PC logo appears.
	- Fast Boot Tip
		- Modern PCs boot very quickly.	
		- If you miss the key:
	- On Windows, Shift + Restart
	- This opens UEFI firmware settings from the recovery menu.

- Navigation and Controls
	- Legacy BIOS interface
		- Blue/black text screen
		- Keyboard only (arrow keys)
		- Esc = go back
		- F10 = save & exit (varies by system)
		- Option to load default settings
	- UEFI interface
		- Graphical menus
		- Mouse support
		- More detailed configuration options
		- Some advanced menus may still use keyboard navigation

- Visual Summary
	- BIOS
		- Text-only
		- 16-bit
		- Keyboard only
		- Older systems
		- Slower boot
	- UEFI
		- Graphical
		- 64-bit
		- Mouse support
		- Faster & more secure
		- Supports larger drives (over 2 TB)
		- Modern standard

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.3 — Boot and Device Options
	
	- The boot option sequence (also called boot priority or boot order) controls the order in which the system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) looks for a bootable device.
	- The boot device that appears first in the list is the one the system tries to load an OS from.


-Common Boot Device Types
	-1. Fixed Disk (HDD or SSD)
		- Most common boot device
		- SATA drives should ideally be connected to the lowest-numbered SATA port
		- Modern systems often use NVMe SSDs (M.2 or PCIe) as boot drives
			- Much faster than SATA SSDs
			- Usually appear in UEFI as “Windows Boot Manager” or the NVMe model name

	- 2. Optical Drive (CD / DVD / Blu-ray)
		- Used when:
			- Installing an OS from a disc
			- Repairing an existing OS
			- Running diagnostic utilities
		- Set as highest priority when you want to boot from a disc.

	- 3. USB Flash Drive
		- most modern systems allow booting from a USB that is formatted as a bootable device.
		- Common uses:
			- Installing operating systems (Windows, Linux, etc.)
			- Running recovery tools
			- BIOS/UEFI updates
		- Must be placed first in the boot order to boot from the USB.

	- 4. Network Boot / PXE (Preboot Execution Environment)
		- Allows booting from:
			- A network server
			- A network-based OS image
		- Used in:
			- Enterprise environments
			- Mass OS deployment
			- Diskless workstations
		- Boots through the network adapter, which retrieves boot files from a server.

- Configuring Boot Order
	- You can change the boot order inside the UEFI/BIOS setup under a menu commonly labeled:
		- Boot Options
		- Boot Sequence
		- Boot Priority
		- Boot Configuration
	- You can reorder devices such as:
		- Windows Boot Manager
		- NVMe SSD
		- SATA HDD/SSD
		- USB Storage Device
		- Optical Drive
		- PXE Boot Network Adapter

- CompTIA A+ Tip
	- If a computer won’t boot, always check:
		- Wrong device set as first priority
		- A USB drive is inserted and taking priority
		- The boot drive isn’t detected
	- Misconfigured boot order is one of the most common causes of “No Boot Device Found.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.4 – USB Permissions (A+ Notes)
	- What it is
	- Computer firmware (BIOS/UEFI) lets you turn hardware on or off, including USB ports.
	
	- Why it matters
		- USB ports can be a security risk, because:
			- People can plug in unauthorized USB drives
			- Malware can spread through USB devices
			- Users might copy data they should not have
		- Because of this, firmware gives you control over USB permissions.

	- What you can control
		- In the UEFI/BIOS setup screen, you may be able to:
			- Enable or disable all USB ports
			- Enable or disable specific USB ports
			- Disable USB storage only, while keeping keyboard/mouse working
			- Lock down external devices for security policies

	- Where you change it
		- You find USB permissions in the firmware setup under menus like:
			- Security
			- Advanced
			- Onboard Devices
			- Integrated Peripherals
	- Admins often disable USB ports in:
		- Schools
		- Businesses
		- Public computers
	- To prevent unauthorized access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.5 – Fan Considerations (A+ Notes)
- Why fans matter
	- Cooling fans keep the computer from overheating.
	- If dust builds up or airflow is blocked, parts can get too hot and become damaged.
	- Good maintenance
		- Clean fans regularly (dust reduces airflow).
		- Make sure airflow is balanced — about the same amount going in and out.
		- Fans should be placed so they move hot air out and cool air in (don’t push hot air downward).

- Fan Settings in BIOS/UEFI
	- You can usually control fan speeds in menus like Cooling, Power, or Advanced.
	- Common fan modes:
		- Balanced – normal cooling for everyday use
		- Cool – higher fan speed for max cooling
		- Quiet – fans run slower, system gets warmer
		- Fanless – fans off; uses passive cooling only
		- Custom – you set the speed yourself
	- Other settings
		- Minimum temperature – the temperature at which fans turn on
		- Duty cycle – how much power the fan receives (higher % = faster spin)
		- UEFI shows current temperature readings from probes near each fan

- Temperature Monitoring
	- 1. Manual Check (BIOS/UEFI)
		- Restart computer
		- Press key (F2, Del, F12, Esc, etc.)
		- Look for Monitoring or Sensors
		- Shows CPU temp and other system temps in real time
	- 2. Third-Party Apps
		- Run inside Windows
		- Use system sensors to read temperatures
		- Can warn you when the PC gets too hot
	- Examples: HWMonitor, Core Temp, Open Hardware Monitor (not required for A+ but good to know)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.6
Boot Passwords and Secure Boot

- Boot Passwords
	- Boot passwords protect the system before the operating system loads.
	- There are two main types:

	- 1. Supervisor / Administrator / Setup / BIOS Password
		- Protects access to the BIOS/UEFI setup menu.
		- Prevents people from changing system settings (boot order, security settings, etc.).
	- 2. User / System Password
		- Locks the entire computer before it boots.
		- The system will not start until the user enters the password.
		- Used mainly on servers or workstations that don’t have people logging in regularly.
	- Note:
		- If multiple people use the computer, everyone must know the password, which reduces security.
		- That’s why system passwords are mainly used on non-interactive systems (like monitoring stations).
- Secure Boot
	- Secure Boot is a UEFI security feature that stops malware from loading at startup.

	- How it works
		- The firmware checks the OS bootloader against trusted digital keys stored in UEFI.
		- If the bootloader is signed and trusted, it loads normally.
		- If the bootloader is edited, infected, or unsigned, the system blocks it from running.

	- Why Secure Boot is important
		- Protects against rootkits and boot-level malware.
		- Required by most modern operating systems.

	- Trusted keys
		- UEFI usually comes with pre-loaded keys for:
		- Microsoft Windows
		- Common Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE)
	- You can:
		- Add keys
		- Remove keys
		- Disable Secure Boot if needed (for certain OS installs or custom bootloaders)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.8
Trusted Platform Modules

- What Encryption Does
	- Encryption scrambles data so only someone with the correct decryption key can read it.
	- Keeping this key safe is extremely important.

- Hashing (Important Difference)
	- Hashing creates a unique code based on data.
	- It checks integrity (that the data hasn’t changed).
	- You cannot get the original data back from a hash.
	- Used for comparing files or verifying passwords.

- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
	- A TPM is a small hardware chip on the motherboard that securely stores:
		- Cryptographic keys
		- Digital certificates
		- Hashed passwords

	- Key Features
		- Each TPM has a unique, permanent endorsement key → this creates a “root of trust.”
		- At boot, the TPM checks hashes of:
			- Firmware
			- Bootloader
			- Operating system kernel to make sure nothing has been changed or tampered with.

- Why TPM Is Important
	- Stores keys in tamper-resistant hardware
		- Far safer than storing keys in software or files.
	- Helps secure:
		- Boot process
		- Disk encryption (like BitLocker)
		- Certificates and login data
	- Keys stored in a TPM cannot be easily extracted by malware.

- Managing a TPM
	- You can:
		- Enable
		- Disable
		- Reset (clear)
		the TPM through BIOS/UEFI.
		The OS (like Windows) also offers management tools.

- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
	- If a computer does not have a TPM, a secure USB device can be used instead.
	- An HSM is:
		- A USB thumb drive used to store encryption keys.
		- “Secure” means you must authenticate with:
			- A password
			- A PIN
			- A fingerprint

- Why Use an HSM?
	- Backup if a TPM fails
	- Move encrypted drives between computers
	- Add hardware-level key security to systems without TPM
